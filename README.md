# c-exercises

```
This is a WIP repository
```

The repository contains some exercises implementations and code exploration for the `c` language.

## Building

For building the exercises, I use the `gcc` compiler with the command:

```
$ gcc -o <output_file> <source_file>.c -Wall
```

This command compile the `source_file` and output the result to an executable `output_file`.

## Executing

For executing the binary file, you can use the command:

```
$ ./<output_file>
```
