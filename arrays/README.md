# Arrays

In C, an array is a collection of a fixed number of values of a single type.

This folder contains the following exercises:

- `sum-array`: Basic exercise that sum the elements (of type `int`) in the array.
- `operations`: More advanced exercise that works with a custom array struct for implementing dynamic-size arrays.
